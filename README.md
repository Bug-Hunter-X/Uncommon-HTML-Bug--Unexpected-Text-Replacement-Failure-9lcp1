# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Text Replacement Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where replacing the text content of a div element using innerHTML and textContent might not work as expected.  The issue arises from potential timing issues or asynchronous operations that might cause the replacement to fail silently.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page with a div element and a script intended to replace the div's content. However, this approach may result in the content not being replaced if the script executes before the DOM is fully loaded or if asynchronous operations involved.
